# EasyShell-Bash-Edition
EasyShell-Bash-Edition is a modern, updated version of EasyShell-NT-Edition - this was the same thing but for Windows and DOS! 

It makes using your Computer easy! You dont enter parameters but instead the Script asks you for everything you need step by step! It creates its own directory to store files, so it doesnt destroy your computer accidentally or deletes important files! THIS IS A W.I.P!

HOW TO USE:
Unzip the downloaded files and go into the folder called "EasyShell-Bash-Edition", then run "./start.sh" via terminal. 
Enter "0" then press the ENTER key!
First enter an account name and a password - these dont need to match your PC! Type "1" and press the ENTER key! Enter the name and password you just entered and then you are ready to go!

WHAT IF I FORGOT MY NAME OR PASSWORD? 
You can reset your Account by restarting the shell with "quit" or pressing CTRL and C at the same time.
Then Start from the Beginning. This will remove Information in future versions of the Shell!

I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO!
If you are inside of the shell and you are logged in, type "help" and press ENTER to open up a document that shows you everything you can do!

I CAN'T DO MUCH, WILL THIS BE ADDED LATER?
This script is currently Work-In-Progress, more things will be added later, whatever will be added, you can see in the "help" menu!
You can also message me to add something i haven't already!

I HAVE A WINDOWS PC, CAN I USE THIS TOO?
Well, yes and no! You can download the new "Windows Terminal", enable Windows Subsystem for Linux and install a linux distro via the Microsoft Store. otherwise you won't be able to run it! 
However there is a Version for Windows! It is called "EasyShell-NT-Edition", but it is currently not uploaded to GitHub!
